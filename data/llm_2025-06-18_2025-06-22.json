    "summary": "With the popularity of large language models (LLMs), undesirable societal\nproblems like misinformation production and academic misconduct have been more\nsevere, making LLM-generated text detection now of unprecedented importance.\nAlthough existing methods have made remarkable progress, a new challenge posed\nby text from privately tuned LLMs remains underexplored. Users could easily\npossess private LLMs by fine-tuning an open-source one with private corpora,\nresulting in a significant performance drop of existing detectors in practice.\nTo address this issue, we propose PhantomHunter, an LLM-generated text detector\nspecialized for detecting text from unseen, privately-tuned LLMs. Its\nfamily-aware learning framework captures family-level traits shared across the\nbase models and their derivatives, instead of memorizing individual\ncharacteristics.

However, deploying these models in real-world scenarios,\nparticularly on resource-constrained devices, remains challenging due to their\nsubstantial computational demands. This has spurred interest in distilling\nknowledge from large VLMs into smaller, more efficient counterparts. A key\nchallenge arises here from the diversity of VLM architectures, which are built\non different LLMs and employ varying token types-differing in vocabulary size,\ntoken splits, and token index ordering. To address this challenge of limitation\nto a specific VLM type, we present Generation after Recalibration (GenRecal), a\nnovel, general-purpose distillation framework for VLMs. GenRecal incorporates a\nRecalibrator that aligns and adapts feature representations between\nheterogeneous VLMs, enabling effective knowledge transfer across different\ntypes of VLMs. Through extensive experiments on multiple challenging\nbenchmarks, we demonstrate that GenRecal significantly improves baseline\nperformances, eventually outperforming large-scale open- and closed-source\nVLMs.",

We present a unifying framework for systematically\nconstructing natural language \"state\" representations for prompting LLM agents\nin repeated multi-agent games. Previous work on games with LLM agents has taken\nan ad hoc approach to encoding game history, which not only obscures the impact\nof state representation on agents' behavior, but also limits comparability\nbetween studies. Our framework addresses these gaps by characterizing methods\nof state representation along three axes: action informativeness (i.e., the\nextent to which the state representation captures actions played); reward\ninformativeness (i.e., the extent to which the state representation describes\nrewards obtained); and prompting style (or natural language compression, i.e.,\nthe extent to which the full text history is summarized).\n  We apply this framework to a dynamic selfish routing game, chosen because it\nadmits a simple equilibrium both in theory and in human subject experiments\n\\cite{rapoport_choice_2009}. Despite the game's relative simplicity, we find\nthat there are key dependencies of LLM agent behavior on the natural language\nstate representation. In particular, we observe that representations which\nprovide agents with (1) summarized, rather than complete, natural language\nrepresentations of past history; (2) information about regrets, rather than raw\npayoffs; and (3) limited information about others' actions lead to behavior\nthat more closely matches game theoretic equilibrium predictions, and with more\nstable game play by the agents. By contrast, other representations can exhibit\neither large deviations from equilibrium, higher variation in dynamic game play\nover time, or both.",

Despite\nsubstantial efforts to improve model safety through alignment, aligned models\ncan still have their safety protections undermined by subsequent fine-tuning -\neven when the additional training data appears benign. In this paper, we\nempirically demonstrate that this vulnerability stems from the sensitivity of\nsafety-critical low-rank subspaces in LLM parameters to fine-tuning. Building\non this insight, we propose a novel training-free method, termed Low-Rank\nExtrapolation (LoX), to enhance safety robustness by extrapolating the safety\nsubspace of an aligned LLM. Our experimental results confirm the effectiveness\nof LoX, demonstrating significant improvements in robustness against both\nbenign and malicious fine-tuning attacks while preserving the model's\nadaptability to new tasks. For instance, LoX leads to 11% to 54% absolute\nreductions in attack success rates (ASR) facing benign or malicious fine-tuning\nattacks.

This latency is particularly evident when LLMs\nare deployed as single-user voice assistants on consumer-grade hardware with\nlimited computing capacity. We discovered that this latency is primarily\ndominated by the time it takes for the LLMs to generate the first sentence,\nwhich is required as input by the TTS systems that synthesize audio responses\non a sentence-by-sentence basis. To address this bottleneck, we propose\nPredictive Generation (PredGen), a novel framework that mitigates-or even\neliminates-this delay through speculative decoding at input time.

RePCS compares two\ninference paths: (i) a parametric path using only the query, and (ii) a\nretrieval-augmented path using both the query and retrieved context by\ncomputing the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between their output\ndistributions.

The conventional approaches to recover from failures are to either use\ncheckpointing, where periodically a copy of the entire model is sent to an\nadditional storage, or redundant computation. These approaches yield\nsignificant communication and/or computation overhead even in non-failure cases\nand scale poorly in settings with large models.

    "summary": "Large language model based multi-agent systems have demonstrated significant\npotential in social simulation and complex task resolution domains. However,\ncurrent frameworks face critical challenges in system architecture design,\ncross-domain generalizability, and performance guarantees, particularly as task\ncomplexity and number of agents increases. We introduces AgentGroupChat-V2, a\nnovel framework addressing these challenges through three core innovations: (1)\na divide-and-conquer fully parallel architecture that decomposes user queries\ninto hierarchical task forest structures enabling dependency management and\ndistributed concurrent processing. (2) an adaptive collaboration engine that\ndynamically selects heterogeneous LLM combinations and interaction modes based\non task characteristics. (3) agent organization optimization strategies\ncombining divide-and-conquer approaches for efficient problem decomposition.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate AgentGroupChat-V2's superior performance\nacross diverse domains, achieving 91.50% accuracy on GSM8K (exceeding the best\nbaseline by 5.6 percentage points), 30.4% accuracy on competition-level AIME\n(nearly doubling other methods), and 79.20% pass@1 on HumanEval. Performance\nadvantages become increasingly pronounced with higher task difficulty,\nparticularly on Level 5 MATH problems where improvements exceed 11 percentage\npoints compared to state-of-the-art baselines. These results confirm that\nAgentGroupChat-V2 provides a comprehensive solution for building efficient,\ngeneral-purpose LLM multi-agent systems with significant advantages in complex\nreasoning scenarios.

    "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, yet\ntheir performance in low-resource languages (LRLs), such as Swahili, often lags\ndue to data scarcity and underrepresentation in pre-training. A key challenge\nis achieving robust cross-lingual lexical alignment, crucial for tasks like\ntranslation and cross-lingual information retrieval. This paper introduces\nTargeted Lexical Injection (TLI), a novel and efficient fine-tuning approach.\nWe first demonstrate that Lugha-Llama-8B-wura, a Swahili-centric LLM, exhibits\nstrong, near-perfect lexical alignment for Swahili-English word pairs in its\nearly internal layers (specifically Layer 2, with ~0.99998 average cosine\nsimilarity based on a pilot study), a capability not fully reflected in its\nfinal output representations (baseline ~0.32 similarity on our evaluation set).\nTLI leverages this insight by using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and a\ncontrastive learning objective to fine-tune the model, specifically targeting\nembeddings from this empirically identified optimal early layer. Our\nexperiments show that TLI significantly improves the output-level lexical\nalignment for 623 trained Swahili-English word pairs, increasing average cosine\nsimilarity from 0.3211 to 0.4113 (+28.08%, p < 1.33 x 10^-240). More\nimportantly, these improvements generalize remarkably well to 63 unseen control\nword pairs, with similarity increasing from 0.3143 to 0.4033 (+28.32%, p < 7.17\nx 10^-27). These findings suggest TLI enhances the model's ability to preserve\nand propagate its inherent early-layer cross-lingual knowledge, offering a\nparameter-efficient and effective strategy for improving lexical alignment in\nLRL-focused LLMs.",

Secure multi-party computation\n(MPC)-based privacy-preserving machine learning offers a powerful approach to\nprotect both model parameters and user data, but its application to LLMs has\nbeen largely limited to inference, as fine-tuning introduces significant\ncomputational challenges, particularly in privacy-preserving backward\npropagation and optimizer operations.

To\naddress these challenges, we propose SecFwT, the first MPC-based framework\ndesigned for efficient, privacy-preserving LLM fine-tuning.

    "title": "Robust Instant Policy: Leveraging Student's t-Regression Model for Robust In-context Imitation Learning of Robot Manipulation",
    "summary": "Imitation learning (IL) aims to enable robots to perform tasks autonomously\nby observing a few human demonstrations. Recently, a variant of IL, called\nIn-Context IL, utilized off-the-shelf large language models (LLMs) as instant\npolicies that understand the context from a few given demonstrations to perform\na new task, rather than explicitly updating network models with large-scale\ndemonstrations. However, its reliability in the robotics domain is undermined\nby hallucination issues such as LLM-based instant policy, which occasionally\ngenerates poor trajectories that deviate from the given demonstrations. To\nalleviate this problem, we propose a new robust in-context imitation learning\nalgorithm called the robust instant policy (RIP), which utilizes a Student's\nt-regression model to be robust against the hallucinated trajectories of\ninstant policies to allow reliable trajectory generation. Specifically, RIP\ngenerates several candidate robot trajectories to complete a given task from an\nLLM and aggregates them using the Student's t-distribution, which is beneficial\nfor ignoring outliers (i.e., hallucinations); thereby, a robust trajectory\nagainst hallucinations is generated. Our experiments, conducted in both\nsimulated and real-world environments, show that RIP significantly outperforms\nstate-of-the-art IL methods, with at least $26\\%$ improvement in task success\nrates, particularly in low-data scenarios for everyday tasks.

    "title": "eLLM: Elastic Memory Management Framework for Efficient LLM Serving",
    "summary": "Large Language Models are increasingly being deployed in datacenters. Serving\nthese models requires careful memory management, as their memory usage includes\nstatic weights, dynamic activations, and key-value caches. While static weights\nare constant and predictable, dynamic components such as activations and KV\ncaches change frequently during runtime, presenting significant challenges for\nefficient memory management. Modern LLM serving systems typically handle\nruntime memory and KV caches at distinct abstraction levels: runtime memory\nmanagement relies on static tensor abstractions, whereas KV caches utilize a\npage table-based virtualization layer built on top of the tensor abstraction.\nThis virtualization dynamically manages KV caches to mitigate memory\nfragmentation. However, this dual-level approach fundamentally isolates runtime\nmemory and KV cache management, resulting in suboptimal memory utilization\nunder dynamic workloads, which can lead to a nearly 20% drop in throughput.\n  To address these limitations, we propose eLLM, an elastic memory management\nframework inspired by the classical memory ballooning mechanism in operating\nsystems. The core components of eLLM include: (1) Virtual Tensor Abstraction,\nwhich decouples the virtual address space of tensors from the physical GPU\nmemory, creating a unified and flexible memory pool; (2) an Elastic Memory\nMechanism that dynamically adjusts memory allocation through runtime memory\ninflation and deflation, leveraging CPU memory as an extensible buffer; and (3)\na Lightweight Scheduling Strategy employing SLO-aware policies to optimize\nmemory utilization and effectively balance performance trade-offs under\nstringent SLO constraints. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that eLLM\nsignificantly outperforms state-of-the-art systems, 2.32x higher decoding\nthroughput, and supporting 3x larger batch sizes for 128K-token inputs.",

    "summary": "Open-domain Dialogue (OD) exhibits a one-to-many (o2m) property, whereby\nmultiple appropriate responses exist for a single dialogue context. Despite\nprior research showing that modeling this property boosts response diversity,\nmost modern LLM-based dialogue agents do not explicitly do so. In this work, we\nmodel the o2m property of OD in LLMs by decomposing OD generation into two key\ntasks: Multi-Response Generation (MRG) and Preference-based Selection (PS),\nwhich entail generating a set of n semantically and lexically diverse\nhigh-quality responses for a given dialogue context, followed by selecting a\nsingle response based on human preference, respectively. To facilitate MRG and\nPS, we introduce o2mDial, a dialogue corpus explicitly designed to capture the\no2m property by featuring multiple plausible responses for each context.\nLeveraging o2mDial, we propose new in-context learning and instruction-tuning\nstrategies, as well as novel evaluation metrics for MRG, alongside a\nmodel-based approach for PS. Empirical results demonstrate that applying the\nproposed two-stage framework to smaller LLMs for OD generation enhances overall\nresponse diversity while maintaining contextual coherence, improving response\nquality by up to 90%, bringing them closer to the performance of larger models.",

To address this gap, we propose PrefBERT, a scoring model for\nevaluating open-ended long-form generation in GRPO and guiding its training\nwith distinct rewards for good and bad outputs.

As a crucial component for developing\nthese reasoning models, reinforcement learning (RL), exemplified by Proximal\nPolicy Optimization (PPO) and its variants, allows models to learn through\ntrial and error. However, PPO can be time-consuming due to its inherent\non-policy nature, which is further exacerbated by increasing response lengths.\nIn this work, we propose Truncated Proximal Policy Optimization (T-PPO), a\nnovel extension to PPO that improves training efficiency by streamlining policy\nupdate and length-restricted response generation. T-PPO mitigates the issue of\nlow hardware utilization, an inherent drawback of fully synchronized\nlong-generation procedures, where resources often sit idle during the waiting\nperiods for complete rollouts. Our contributions are two-folds. First, we\npropose Extended Generalized Advantage Estimation (EGAE) for advantage\nestimation derived from incomplete responses while maintaining the integrity of\npolicy learning. Second, we devise a computationally optimized mechanism that\nallows for the independent optimization of the policy and value models.
